# InsightDataEngineering-18B

# Project Idea
Designing a pipeline for collaboratively build and maintain an image metadata dataset.

# What is the purpose, and most common use cases?
The purpose is to provide a platform for researcher to query and retrieve image metadata to train a custom classifier.

Consider how google translate works and ask participating for translating new words or verifying previous translation by other people. The goal is to provide the same thing for labeling images and bounding boxes inside of the images, but is open to public. Researchers can query images and download the metadata. Contributors can add images or change labels. Meaning of images can change or becomes meaningless over time! (Kids even donâ€™t know what a floppy disk is)

# Scale of the data
The Open Image Dataset contains ~ 9 million records which will be used as a seed. This data can be used multiple times to load test the system.

World Population ~ 7.6 Billion <br/>
The number of smartphone ~ 5 Billion <br/>
If 1% contribute 10 images with 3 labels  ~ 50 million * 10 * 3 (1.5 Billion labels)

# Challenges
Small number of tables (~5) but can grow tremendously
* needs partitioning

Should handle arbitrary queries

Should handle different type of request with a queue (Kafka, RabbitMQ)
* Common queries (in-memory database like Redis)
* Complex Queries (can handle join on big tables like Redshift)

Data will be stored on a distributed file system (HDFS)
